        <p>At Delta 7, our team concept centers around the fusion of innovation, teamwork, and a deep appreciation 
          for the Formula 1 legacy. Inspired by the renowned racing teams, we aim to create a visually captivating 
          car that excels in speed and aerodynamics. By incorporating cutting-edge technology, such as advanced CFD 
          simulations and lightweight materials, we push the boundaries of performance. Through collaborative teamwork, 
          we leverage our diverse skills to overcome challenges and continuously strive for excellence. With a relentless
          pursuit of innovation, Delta 7 aims to leave a lasting impact in the F1 in Schools competition and inspire

            <li>Drawing inspiration from the concept of Epsilon⁰, 
              the permitivity of free space in physics, our car's name, Epsilon, pays
               homage to the fundamental properties of space. Epsilon Zero represents 
               the measure of a vacuum's ability to support electric fields, serving as
                a benchmark for the interaction of charged particles. By adopting the 
                name Epsilon, we embody the spirit of pushing boundaries and breaking 
                barriers in our pursuit of speed and performance. Just as Epsilon Zero
                 allows for the uninhibited propagation of electric fields, our car, 
                 Epsilon, represents our commitment to unleashing the full potential 
                 of engineering and technology, propelling us to new heights on the 
                 racetrack. With sleek design, advanced aerodynamics, and cutting-edge
                  innovations, Epsilon exemplifies our dedication to harnessing the 
                  power of physics and technology to create a winning formula.
